        <h2>Words of Wisdom</h2>
        <p>God showed ... a little thing the size of a hazelnut in the palm of my hand; and it was as round as a ball.
            <br /> I looked on it with the eye of my understanding and thought what may this be? And I was answered thus: 'It is all that is made'.
            <br /> I marvelled how it could last;
            <br /> for I thought it might disappear altogether it was so little.
            <br /> And I was answered in my understanding, 'It will last forever, for God loves it' and so everything that has being has the love of God...
            <br /><small><em>(from A Revelation of Love by Julian of Norwich.)</em></small></p>

        <p>'There was a very cautious man who never laughed or played;
            <br /> he never risked, he never tried, he never sang or prayed.
            <br /> And when one day he passed away, his insurance was denied;
            <br /> for since he never really lived, they claimed he never died.'
        </p>

        <p>‘Christian life is not about theology or churches or saints,
            <br /> but of the hungry and poor.
            <br /> Its not about creeds and doctrines,
            <br /> but of shelter and clothing.
            <br /> Its not about bibles and prayer books,
            <br /> but of cups of cold water given in Christ's name’
            <br />
            <small><em>(Michael McGoldrick, Lurgan)</em></small></p>

        <p>&quot;Work like you don't need the money.
            <br /> Love like you've never been hurt.
            <br /> Dance like nobody's watching.
            <br /> Sing like nobody's listening.
            <br /> Live like it's Heaven on Earth.&quot;

        <p>&quot;Forgiveness is the fragrance the violet sheds
            <br /> on the heel that has crushed it.&quot;
            <br />
            <small><em>(Mark Twain)</em></small></p>

        <p>‘Pray as if everything depends on God
            <br /> Work as if everything depends on you’
            <br />
            <br />‘Without God we can't do it.
            <br /> Without us God won't do it.'
            <br />
