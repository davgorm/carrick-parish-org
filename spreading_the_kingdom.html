        <h2>Spreading His Kingdom</h2>
        <h3>With the Fervour of the Saints</h3>
        <p>One too frequently hears it said, in various terms, that to impose a truth, be it that of the Gospel, or to impose a way, be it that of salvation, cannot but be a violation of religious liberty. Besides, it is added, why proclaim the Gospel when the whole world is saved by uprightness of heart? We know likewise that the world and history are filled with &quot;seeds of the Word&quot;; is it not therefore an illusion to claim to bring the Gospel where it already exists in the seeds that the Lord himself has sown?</p>
        <p class="lead">It would certainly be an error to impose something on the consciences people.
 But to propose to their consciences the truth of the Gospel and salvation in
Jesus Christ, with complete clarity and with a total respect for the free options which it
presents -&quot;without coercion, or dishonourable or unworthy pressure&quot; - far
from being an attack on religious liberty is fully to respect that liberty, which is offered the choice of a way that even non-believers consider noble and uplifting.</p>
        <p>Is it then a crime against others' freedom to proclaim with joy a Good News which one has come to know through the Lord's mercy? And why should only falsehood and error, debasement and pornography have the right to be put before people and often unfortunately imposed on them by the destructive propaganda of the mass media, by the tolerance of legislation, the timidity of the good and the impudence of the wicked?</p>
        <p>The respectful presentation of Christ and his Kingdom is more than the evangelizer's right; it is his duty. It is likewise the right of his fellowmen to receive from him the proclamation of the Good News of salvation. God can accomplish this salvation in whomsoever he wishes by ways which he alone knows. And yet, if his Son came, it was precisely in order to reveal to us, by his Word and by His life, the ordinary paths of salvation. And He has commanded us to transmit this revelation to others with his own authority. It would be useful if every Christian and every evangelizer were to pray about the following thought: men can gain salvation also in other ways, by God's mercy, even though we do not preach the Gospel to them; but as for us, can we gain salvation if through negligence or fear or shame - what Saint Paul called &quot;blushing for the Gospel&quot; or as a result of false ideas we fail to preach it? For that would be to betray the call of God, who wishes the seed to bear fruit through the voice of the ministers of the Gospel; and it will depend on us whether this grows into trees and produces its full fruit.</p>
        <p>Let us therefore preserve our fervour of
Spirit. Let us preserve the delightful and comforting joy of evangelizing,
even when it is in tears that we must sow. May it mean for us - as it did for John
the Baptist, for Peter and Paul, for the other Apostles and for a multitude of splendid
evangelizers all through the Church's history - an interior enthusiasm that nobody and
nothing can quench. May it be the great joy of our consecrated lives.
And may the world of our time, which is searching, sometimes with anguish, sometimes with
hope, be enabled to receive the Good News not from evangelisers who are dejected
discouraged, impatient or anxious, but from ministers of the Gospel whose lives glow with
fervour, who have first received the joy of Christ, and who are willing to risk their
lives so that the Kingdom may be proclaimed and the Church established in the midst of the
            world.</p>
