    <h2>Words of Wisdom</h2>
    <p>God showed ... a little thing the size of a hazelnut in the palm of my hand; and it was as round as a ball.
        <br /> I looked on it with the eye of my understanding and thought what may this be? And I was answered thus: 'It is all that is made'.
        <br /> I marvelled how it could last;
        <br /> for I thought it might disappear altogether it was so little.
        <br /> And I was answered in my understanding, 'It will last forever, for God loves it' and so everything that has being has the love of God...

    <p>'There was a very cautious man who never laughed or played;
        <br /> he never risked, he never tried, he never sang or prayed.
        <br /> And when one day he passed away, his insurance was denied;
        <br /> for since he never really lived, they claimed he never died.'

    <p>‘Christian life is not about theology or churches or saints,
        <br /> but of the hungry and poor.
        <br /> Its not about creeds and doctrines,
        <br /> but of shelter and clothing.
        <br /> Its not about bibles and prayer books,
        <br /> but of cups of cold water given in Christ's name’
        <br />

    <p>&quot;Work like you don't need the money.
        <br /> Love like you've never been hurt.
        <br /> Dance like nobody's watching.
        <br /> Sing like nobody's listening.
        <br /> Live like it's Heaven on Earth.&quot;

    <p>&quot;Forgiveness is the fragrance the violet sheds
        <br /> on the heel that has crushed it.&quot;

    <p>‘Pray as if everything depends on God
        <br /> Work as if everything depends on you’

        <br /> Without us God won't do it.'
