    <blockquote>
        <h1>Prayer For Parish Cells</h1>
        <p>Heavenly Father you sent the Holy Spirit into your Church at Pentecost filling the apostles with your power and renewing them in your love. Grant our Cells an outpouring of that same Holy Spirit enabling us:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>to have an even deeper experience of your Presence in our daily lives</li>
            <li>to go out boldly and share this new life with all in our community,</li>
            <li>to dispel all our fears so that in serving you we will invite rich and poor alike to 'come and see' at your banquet,</li>
            <li>to share all we have, joys and sorrows alike thus binding us together like a real community,
            </li>
            <li>to change so much that others, by our example will want to belong.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We make this prayer through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>
