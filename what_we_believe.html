        <h2>We believe in one God</h2>
        <p class="lead">The following is our statement of faith.
            <br /> We declare this every Sunday morning when we gather for worship.
            <br /> We believe in one God, the Father, the Almighty,
            <br /> maker of heaven and earth, of all that is, seen and unseen.</p>
        <p>We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,
            <br /> the only Son of God,
            <br /> eternally begotten of the Father.
            <br /> God from God, Light from Light,
            <br /> true God from true God,
            <br /> begotten, not made,
            <br /> of one Being with the Father.
            <br /> Through Him all things were made.
            <br /> For us men and for our salvation
            <br /> He came down from heaven:
            <br /> by the power of the Holy Spirit
            <br /> He became incarnate from the Virgin Mary and was made man.
            <br /> For our sake He was crucified under Pontius Pilate;
            <br /> He suffered death and was buried.
            <br /> On the third day he rose again in accordance with the Scriptures;
            <br /> He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father.
            <br /> He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,
            <br /> and His kingdom will have no end.</p>
        <p>We believe in the Holy Spirit,
            <br /> the Lord, the giver of life,
            <br /> who proceeds from the Father and the Son.
            <br /> With the Father and the Son He is worshipped and glorified.
            <br /> He has spoken through the Prophets.</p>
        <p>We believe in one holy, catholic and apostolic Church.
            <br /> We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.
            <br /> We look for the resurrection of the dead,
            <br /> and the life of the world to come.</p>
